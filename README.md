## Getting GDTOT COOKIES
- Watch This [Video](https://youtu.be/PjR6KpHJ23s)

## Getting Google OAuth API credential file

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
- Choose Desktop and Create.
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- clone this repo https://github.com/tekeayush/Mirror-bot
- Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to credentials.json
- install the requirements-cli.txt file by using

``` pip3 install -r requirements-cli.txt ```

- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:
```
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Deploying on vps

- Start docker daemon (skip if already running):
```
sudo dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```
sudo docker build . -t mirrorbot
```
- Run the image:
```
sudo docker run mirrorbot
```


## bot commands will be set automatically 

## some of the commands are changed because the group members use them without any reason 

## Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True"** in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
**NOTE**: Using service accounts is only recommended while uploading to a team drive.

## Generate service accounts. [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)


first enable IAM API from cloud console by Visiting [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)

Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 service accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

## Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

## Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the [.netrc] file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
where host is the name of extractor (eg. youtube, twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line
